        <h1>All About Alana</h1> 
<p id="nav-p"> HELLO! I am Alana and this is some more about me. <br> 
  I am a graduating Senior at the University of Rhode Island, originally from Webster Massachuessetts. <br>
    I LOVE being outside in nature. I practice spirituality so being out in nature is a big part of connecting and grounding for me. Along with spirituality I also read tarot! <br>

    I am an extremely passionate person! I love the arts, creating and performing. Which all fits perfectly with my major in Theatre. <br>

    That being said, programming is not something that comes naturally to me. However, I am confident that my love for problem solving will get me through my programming class! <br>
    More to come soon... </p>
